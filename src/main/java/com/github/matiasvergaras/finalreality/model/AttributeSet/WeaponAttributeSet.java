/**
 * A class to hold all the possible attributes of a weapon.
 * <p> In order to avoid having to ask for the type or downcast/upcast every time that we want to get attributes from a
 * weapon, we need a transversal way to get their attributes.</p>
 * <p> To achieve that without weakening the code, we created a special class to hold the attributes. This way we
 * avoid having maps or list with Object type or String-type keys. </p>
 * <p> Every  Weapon will have a getAttribute method that will create and return a new AttributeSet.</p>
 * <p> If a character does not have an attribute, the AttributeSet will keep '0' as value. This is to
 * avoid having a lot of null pointers that could lead to exceptions while executing the program. </p>
