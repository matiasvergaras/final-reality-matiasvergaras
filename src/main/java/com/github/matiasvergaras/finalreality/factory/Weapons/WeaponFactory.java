/**
 * Weapon Factory.
 * <p> An Abstract Weapon Factory that holds the common methods related to the production of every kind of weapons.</p>
 * <p> To avoid overcomplicating the code at a stage when it is not necessary yet (and won't be for a long time),
 * all specific character factories will inherit the setMagicPower method from this class, even if their creations do
 * not use them. This will also allow us to avoid using downcast at the Controller. </p>
 * <p> Factories will allow us to avoid tight coupling between the controller and the concrete products. This way,
 * Controller will request characters from the factories, who will make the corresponding calls to the model
 * constructors. </p>
 * <p> We will use the Singleton Pattern with each concrete Factory, since there should not be more than 1 instance
 * of each of them at the same time (given the methods to configure them without need to create another one). </p>
