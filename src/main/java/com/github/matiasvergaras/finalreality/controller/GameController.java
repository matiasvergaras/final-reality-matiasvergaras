/**
 * Game Controller.
 * The controller will be an intermediary between the user and the objects of the model,
 * whose purpose will be to control all the messages that pass through it, manipulating
 * and redirecting those that are necessary.
 * <p> User will communicate with GUI, GUI with Controller,  and Controller will do with the Masterminds
 * CPUMastermind and PlayerMasterminds, which in time will communicate with the rest of the model. </p>
 * <p> GameController will have a some phases (State Pattern). They can be divided in 3 main phases: "Initializing",
 * that defines the time when the user is setting-up the game, his characters, weapons, etc., "Active",
 * that is when the player is fighting against the CPU, and "Finished", that is when the user is
 * able to see the final state of the game and to know who wins. In finished mode the user is also
 * able to config a new game, turning back onto Initializing State. </p>
 * <p> There are 6 kinds of Active Phase: PlayerTurn, CPUTurn, SelectingAttackTarget, PerformingAttack, SettingNewTurn,
 * and ShowwingTurnResume. </p>
